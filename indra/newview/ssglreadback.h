// <SS:Nexii> A generic texture->CPU readback worker. One dedicated thread with its own GL context shared with the viewer's (createSharedContext -> makeContextCurrent -> gGL.init, the LLImageGLThread lifecycle), so readbacks that would otherwise stall the frame loop - glGetTexImage of depth maps, volume data, baked textures - run behind it. The caller renders into the source texture on the main thread and submits a Job; the worker waits on a fence (never reading a half-written texture), copies the texels into a buffer, and posts the result back to the mainloop queue. The worker touches no viewer GL state: the read uses raw GL only, so it cannot mutate the main thread's GL state machine (gGL, LLVertexBuffer, the bound-shader statics). The generic form of the pattern SSWindFlowMap's SSWindFlowGLWorker proved out, so the atmo systems that read textures (rain shadow, world field bands, wind flow) share one worker instead of each building one. Contract: the source texture must stay allocated and unre-rendered, unreallocated until the Job's completion callback runs. Capture pipelines that reuse one render target (rain shadows, world field bands) serialize by not starting the next render while a readback is outstanding.

    // <SS:Nexii> The seasonal rack: -15C is deep winter, +35C a summer heatwave - the storm deck's base rides between the two rails, and no deck ever grows past a kilometre of thickness. Winter air is dense and squashes the atmosphere down (a winter storm's base hangs low over the ground); summer heat lifts the whole sky. The base follows the temperature NONLINEARLY - a cubic centred on the neutral 10C midpoint that is FLAT in the middle and steepest at the rails: through ordinary spring/autumn weather (and a day's worth of temperature drift) the deck parks near its mid altitude, and only climbs to the summer high or sinks to the winter low as the temperature approaches the season's extremes. The extremes set the rack; the curve keeps everyday weather from dragging the deck around.

It survives as a modifier - a churning deck is deeper and more ragged than a still one - never as a gate.

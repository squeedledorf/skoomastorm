// <SS:Nexii> The thread behind SSGLReadback: one worker with its own GL context shared with the viewer's, lifecycle mirroring LLImageGLThread and SSWindFlowMap's SSWindFlowGLWorker (createSharedContext -> makeContextCurrent -> gGL.init -> service queue -> gGL.shutdown -> destroySharedContext). The body uses only raw GL - never gGL, LLVertexBuffer or the bound-shader statics - so it cannot disturb the main thread's GL state. mStarted flips the instant the thread services its queue; createWorker waits on it so a worker whose GL setup failed is caught immediately and never trusted with jobs.

// wider tile, bigger features - so an imported day cycle's keyframed Scale dial changes the
// pattern again, but only through the CROSSFADE built from it (see the branch calls in main): the
// two endpoint scales' renderings are blended, never the divisor interpolated, so the sheets do
// not appear to move while the dial plays. Calibrated for the band's 6 km DEFAULT (the cirrus
// layer's default height): the visibly solid sky spans ~4 band-heights of reach before the
// horizon fade takes it (zenith to ~3 degrees of elevation), so a 32 km tile reads as a 3x3-to-4x4
// repeat across the dome - one tile ~5x the band's height, the broad composition the layer
// is tuned for. (The first pin's 8 km read as ~24 repeats marching into the horizon; the

// band moved.)

//
// The Scale dial's identity point: an authored scale of 0.25 means "the anchor tile, exactly the
// render before the dial was re-added" - the divisor below collapses to the tile pin. Above the
// anchor the tile widens (fewer repeats, larger cloud features), below it narrows. Mirrored by the

// <SS:Nexii> THE GEOMETRY IN THIS BLOCK IS A TRANSLITERATION, NOT AN ORIGINAL. indra/newview/ssshellcore.h (namespace SSShell) is the AUTHORITY for every formula here - the ray/shell intersection on both faces, the rim derived from its discriminant, the rim fade, the layer's own dissolve, the fine-octave give-up and the flat fallback - and the bodies below follow that header statement for statement so V:\Scratch\atmo\tests\twin_shell.cpp can pin the two together over a grid. The geometry moved out of this file because phase 8c adds a SECOND shell at the volumetric deck's own altitude (doc/atmo_magic_phase8_show.md section 5): three of the constants this band used to bake in - the 32 km tile, the 0.125 parallax damp, the 100/250 km detail rails - were calibrated to the CIRRUS band and blocked a second caller, so they are arguments now and this band passes its own values unchanged.

// record of the calibration it passes in).
//
// One band's base UVs, and how much of the band survives. Intersect the view ray with the band's
// deck, anchor at the region centre, subtract the wind travel, and divide by a PINNED
// metres-per-uv (see THE TILE IS PINNED below). vary_ray_dir rides the dome mesh's Y-up local space (renderDome's 120 degree
// permute: local y is world UP, local x is world Y, local z is world X), so the horizontal
// components reach deck_m as (ray.z, ray.x) - east, north, matching region_offset's (world X,
// world Y) order.
//
// THE TILE IS PINNED - deliberately free of the band's HEIGHT, and of the Scale dial's
// CONTINUOUS play only because the dial is re-added as the crossfade built on this function (see
// the branch calls in main). One tile is one fixed piece of world: the height above the camera
// survives into the pattern (vertical parallax, on the flat fallback too), altitude changes slide
// instead of zoom. What `scale` does here is pick WHICH pin the plane samples at: the divisor is
// p.tileM * scale / p.scaleAnchor, so an authored 0.25 is identity - the exact
// pre-dial render - and any other authored value tiles the pattern by that factor (wider for
// larger, like the stock divide-by-cloud_scale it restores). (An earlier cut anchored the tile at
// 2*alt*cloud_scale - stock EEP's zenith calibration - which matched stock at any altitude but
// breathed the pattern as the band moved and cancelled the vertical parallax out of the static
// pattern entirely.)
//
// THE DECK CURVES. With ss_planet_orbit_m set, the ray meets a SPHERE centred on the planet at
// radius orbit + deck height - the deck is a finite disc that terminates at its own curved horizon
// (the tangent elevation sqrt(2*alt/orbit), about 1.4 degrees for a 1500 m deck under a 5000 km
// home planet) instead of stretching flat into the world's horizon line. The camera's own height
// rides the orbit uniform, so the shell stays at its world altitude while you fly: rising toward
// it brings its rim up and over. Above the shell the near intersection switches to the minus root
// and only down-rays hit - the deck seen from above. Orbit 0 keeps the flat-deck fallback.
//
// The flat fallback's denominator is SOFTENED, not clamped: (1+F)*alt / (|up| + F) is smooth in
// the ray everywhere, exact at the zenith, and caps the deck distance at ~10 band-altitudes in
// the horizon fold. The old hard max(up, 0.02) clamp did two kinds of damage the horizon fade
// never hid: below ~1.2 degrees it froze the UVs into an azimuth-only field, which smears the
// band into vertical stripes toward the horizon, and exactly on the clamp line the screen-space
// derivative jumps, which collapses the mip selection into a grid of tile boundaries in the
// distance. The sphere needs no fold: it is smooth to its own edge and bounded beyond it.
//
// The world-anchored terms - camera travel and wind drift - run DAMPED: the shipped vertex nudge
// moved at one eighth of the plane-honest rate (its /16 compensation over the stock 2*cs-radian
// zenith tile, hand-tuned in the live viewer), and the undamped plane rate read as the deck
// swimming. The ray's own hit keeps the honest geometry; only the terms that MOVE are damped, so
// the motion matches the version the eye tuned. Sign conventions are the old vertex patches':
// world north runs down the texture's v, and the wind travel negates the same way.
//
// NO DOMAIN WARP. An earlier cut ran three nested warp levels at incommensurate frequencies and
// rotated frames - an attempt at aperiodic tiling against the pinned tile, where the same
// clumps can genuinely march across the sky in rows toward the horizon. It read as smear and
// buckle, not as aperiodicity: a displacement field sampled from the same map it displaces is
// itself periodic, so the warped grid was still a grid, just bent. The mapping is a straight,
// honest lookup now - the repetition is softened by the fine octave's distance fade and by an
// authored large map (ss_noise_large) art-directing the broad octave when one is set.
// <SS:Nexii> The cirrus band's call site: bind this band's uniforms and its own nine constants to the shared shell mapping above. The body that used to live here is ss_shell_plane_base, transliterated from SSShell::planeBase; nothing about the render changes, and the harness proves that rather than asserting it (twin_shell.cpp SS_CHECK_BITS's the core against a transliteration of the PRE-refactor spelling of this function over a grid of altitudes, rays, scales, offsets, drifts and orbits, including the flat fallback).

// The curved deck's own horizon fade (mechanism: ss_shell_edge_fade above, SSShell::edgeFade in the
// core). The layer ends at the rim its discriminant defines - sqrt(2*alt/orbit) to first order - and
// the last stretch before the rim compresses endlessly, so the band dissolves across the approach:
// alpha zero at the rim, full a fraction of the rim's elevation away from it. The edge reads as a
// curved cloud horizon melting into the atmosphere rather than a smeared seam. BOTH faces melt now;
// on the far face the rim is a real miss boundary (flatter rays pass over the shell), on the near
// face it is the elevation at which the shell crosses the camera's own horizontal plane.
//
// <SS:Nexii> The melt's TOP follows the volumetric deck's perceived edge (ss_deck_edge_sin) when one stands over the camera. The deck's own field ends at ~4.9 km horizontal - several degrees UP the sky from the band's rim - and past that edge the band has no cloud in front of it, so letting it run saturated to the waterline painted a flat grey plane across the whole span between the deck's edge and the horizon. The melt now spends that span: full at the deck's edge, gone at the rim. No deck, or the camera up near the deck's top (its edge sine below the old window's top), keeps the old narrow melt.

The sky's own cloud_scale uniform holds the fade's FROM endpoint - the applier keeps valueAt there (blendAt's from is the same keyframe) - and ss_cloud_scale_to names the TO endpoint with the eased weight. Both endpoints run the whole density chain at THEIR tile (SS_SCALE_ANCHOR makes an authored 0.25 the pre-dial anchor pin), and the two resulting opacities are mixed by the weight: the two endpoint-scale renderings crossfade, the divisor between them is never interpolated. An interpolated divisor is the erratic motion this replaces - zooming the tile mid-fade drags every feature sideways as the pivot point moves, reading as the clouds creeping when they should stand still. The TO plate is the FROM base scaled by from/to: the plane base is a pure metres/divisor quotient, so the partner is the same ray, the same fades and the same anchor - one geometric intersection, no recompute. A live Cloud Image crossfade composes exactly: its two maps are mixed inside cloudNoise(), which both plates call after their own UVs, so the two dials fade on their own axes regardless of where each set its keyframes.

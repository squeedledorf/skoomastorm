// <SS:Nexii> S1 vertex-decode channel fix (doc/atmo_magic_flow_field.md section 2, opus review Q2b): widened
// vec2 -> vec4, ZERO new interpolator slots (varyings are vec4-granular on every target; the file's live
// component count was already well under the vec4 boundary). texcoord0 arrives per-corner EXACT (0 or 1 on each
// axis, plus this stage's own payload*0.45 - see ssvolcloud.cpp's render()); round()/subtract happens HERE,
// before the rasterizer ever interpolates the value, because recovering payload from an already-interpolated
// coordinate is unsound (round() on a mid-quad value is a step function, not the corner) - the fragment stage
// used to read this varying directly as a vec2 card/window coordinate and now reads vary_texcoord0.xy for
// exactly that (the decoded corner - bit-identical to the old raw value at payload 0, and exact for the whole
// payload domain because |payload * 0.45| <= 0.45 < 0.5), plus .zw for the decoded payload.
// <SS:Nexii> SOMETHING RIDES IT NOW (fifth build report; [interaction: ssdeckflowcore.h]): .z carries an ordinary
// puff's flow SWIRL, SSDeckFlow::swirlUnit read at the puff's air-frame cell centre and spent by the fragment
// stage as a bounded rotation of the billow's outflow azimuth. Same value on all four corners, so the varying is
// constant across the quad. Shafts and the sheet still write a zero payload and never read this.
out vec4 vary_texcoord0;

// <SS:Nexii> Per-puff STRUCTURE only, no longer a finished colour: r is the CPU builder's form term (facing toward the light and the exponential shade down through the deck, beam-flattened),
// g the puff's buried depth (SSVolCloud::Puff::mBuried - sunless, so it survives a moonless overcast), a the puff's edge-fade alpha; b encodes EITHER a virga shaft card's flag AND its drive
// (phase 8e item 4, DRIVE REACHES THE FRAGMENT): 0.5 + 0.5 * SSVolCloud::Puff::mDrive for a shaft (ssvirgacore.h, doc/atmo_magic_far_clouds.md section 3 phase 6c; always > 0.5 since a
// qualifying cell's drive is always > 0) - OR, for an ordinary puff (S2, doc/atmo_magic_flow_field.md section 2), the per-puff advected-detail PHASE: SSVolCloud::Puff::mPhase * 0.49, always
// < 0.5 so it can never trip the shaft flag test. 0 for the sheet, which reads neither. ssVolCloudF.glsl's main() branches its whole carve on vary_color.b > 0.5 rather than shape/rim/n_map
// logic (a shaft has no lid or floor to carve), then recovers drive from the same channel as clamp((vary_color.b - 0.5) * 2.0, 0.0, 1.0) to shape its body floor, streak amplitude and
// evaporation mask by intensity; the puff branch recovers phase as clamp(vary_color.b, 0.0, 0.49) / 0.49 and folds it into the advected octave's cycle. The colour it used to carry was
// (ambient + sun * form) with the sun run through a CPU replica of the beam extinction - the replica whose cosecant underflows to grey at every low sun, so the deck sat flat white-grey under
// every authored sunset while the dome beside it burned. The light half is computed below instead.

// <SS:Nexii> The deck's light: the DOME CLOUD BAND'S OWN COLOURS (cloudsV.glsl's vary_CloudColorSun / vary_CloudColorAmbient / vary_CloudGlow), computed here per corner by the band's own
// maths on the band's own ray convention, so the puffs are shaded as a piece of the same layer the cirrus band is - which is the whole assignment. Two conventions matter and both bit us:
//
// FRAME - the dome shaders run in the ogl frame lightnorm is uploaded in (LLEnvironment::toLightNorm permutes world x,y,z to y,z,x; +Y is up), while this field's geometry lives in world
// axes (+Z up). The view ray is permuted into the ogl frame below and everything past that line is cloudsV's code shape, swizzles and all.
//
// RAY LENGTH - the band's cloud colours are multiplied by the transmittance along the ray before anything is drawn, and the length of that ray is a convention, not a measurement: the dome
// extends every ray to the atmosphere slab (tens of km at the horizon, and a 32km stretch for the downward rays a dome only shows below its horizon). The deck is real geometry seen from
// any side, so it runs the rim-eased hybrid instead - the deck's own true range near, the dome's slab convention at the rim where it must melt into the band - and the atmosphere is
// inside these colours with no separate fog pass to disagree with it, exactly as it is inside the band's. See the long note at haze_len in main() for how both pure conventions failed.

out float vary_ss_glow;

// <SS:Nexii> The GRAZE LIGHT's weight - how much extra of the warm capped sun this vertex earns for standing high in the deck while the sun stands low against it. At a grazing sun the
// deck's real occlusion IS height: the beam runs nearly horizontal, so the top of the layer has a clear line to the sun while everything under it sits in the deck's own shadow - which is
// the alpenglow, the lit lid over a dark volume, seen from above, from inside, and through any gap. The per-puff form term cannot say this: its facing half scales with the sun's VERTICAL
// component (zero at the horizon, exactly when the effect peaks) and its shade half only ever darkens. A ramp of the sun coefficient over height-in-layer says it directly - the volume
// brightening bottom to top - with a sharp crest over the lid band, where the puffs that ARE the deck's surface catch the skim. Gated by how grazing the sun is: as it climbs past ~30
// degrees the beam arrives from above, the CPU shade term already owns the vertical story, and this fades out rather than double-lighting the tops. Spent in the fragment stage on a gentler
// wrap of its own past the body's full one (SS_GRAZE_DARK there), riding the same warm sunlit colour and the same gloom - the sun side of each crown still burns brightest, but the far side
// is never left out of a sky that lights the lid from every quarter.

// on its own rather than folded into the ambient, because it is not the cloud's light and must not wear the cloud's shading: folded in, the fragment stage multiplied it by the storm gloom
// and by the wrap/noise mids, which stripped the warm dawn air off the deck (the cold navy puffs under a pink cirrus band) and left the deck meeting the horizon band ~35% darker than the
// band it joins. Added after all cloud shaping instead, both converge to the SAME pure airlight at the rim - the handoff is exact by construction. [interaction: dome handoff]

// position however much cloud stood in the way, thin streaks around it ignited and the one thick puff on the disc left as a dark silhouette inside the fire. The deck's sun story is its GEOMETRY
// - the wrap, the CPU form term, the graze lid - and the disc itself belongs to the dome behind, obscured by the puffs' ordinary alpha like anything else the deck stands in front of. So the cone
// is capped here and the cap eased back out across the rim band, where the last rows must wear exactly the glow the band they melt into wears - a horizon sunset keeps its fire (those puffs ARE

// ray meets the deck at little more than the layer's own height above or below the eye, so the puffs straight overhead - and straight underfoot, flying above the deck - carried a fraction of the
// air the band behind them wears at the same angle (the band's SHORTEST ray is the whole max_y column), and the deck kept a dim unhazed disc riding the camera's vertical: dark navy under a dusk
// sky while the slant field around it took the airlight, grey under a sunrise while the band burned. Absolute rather than a share of the ray's own slab, deliberately - near the horizon the slab
// convention runs to twenty slabs' length, and a share of THAT would dissolve a puff at arm's length at eye level into pure airlight. max_y is the one length the atmosphere's maths is calibrated
// against, so half of it veils a puff exactly as much as half the zenith column veils the dome; and slab_len >= max_y at every angle, so the floor can never exceed the slab convention and the
// rim easing below stays a one-way trip to the band's own figure. The same floor is what lets a sunrise reach the whole deck: the airlight between eye and puff is where the horizon's fire

    // of air: transmittance zero, cloud terms extinguished, and the entire field rendered as bare airlight - pale grey everywhere, white fire in the glow cone, no trace of the sun on any
    // cloud body. But shading by bare metric distance is no better - that was the first grey deck - because the band the far puffs must join IS painted with the slab maths. So the path is the
    // deck's own TRUE range near, capped at the slab convention the ray would carry anyway, eased up to that convention across the same rim band the fragment stage flattens over, so the last

    // centred on the eye, sliding across the deck with every camera move, which is the one thing a sky must never do. The true range is a real distance at every angle and agrees with the old

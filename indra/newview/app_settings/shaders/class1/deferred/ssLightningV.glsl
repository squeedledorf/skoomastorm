// <SS:Nexii> Atmo Magic lightning

//[ENGINE_BLOCK Matrices]

// The same far-field squash and ss_squash uniform the puff field's vertex shader applies - one mapping, so a bolt inside a far cloud stays inside it in drawn depth too. Per vertex,
// each keeps its exact ray from the camera, replacing the old CPU per-strike scale (which collapsed everything beyond a limit onto one shell; this compresses progressively and
// a 5km crawler spanning the knee bends correctly through it).
uniform vec3 ss_squash;
uniform vec3 ss_cam_pos;

// Every quad of the pass arrives through one vertex buffer (sslightningrender.cpp builds it): position and texcoord0 as before, and beside the 8-bit tint two float attributes the
// immediate-mode path could never carry - normal (the per-vertex data the fragment stage reads: noise seed / amber weight / plasma phase for ribbons, anchor depth / height above ground for discs)
// and tangent (HDR brightness above white, a mode-specific weight, the depth soft width, and the fragment mode in w).

Computed below as the same capped-glow light the sunset band renders with, evaluated along the sun's own path - a per-frame constant the halo family wears uniformly. The optics' old tint was bound CPU-side from an uncapped beam replication that underflowed to zero within a degree of the horizon and snapped to the raw near-white authored sun colour; this is the light the eye actually sees, so the halos keep their sunrise/sunset colour down through the horizon band and below it. Degenerate only when the base light itself is - an active env with no sun up and no moon colour, where the optics are gated off anyway.

// <SS:Nexii> Below-horizon ray treatment: 1 mirrors the ray (Atmo look), 0 leaves the stock -32000 collapse. Zero unless an ACTIVE Atmo environment is driving the sky (lldrawpoolwlsky.cpp), so an enabled-but-idle viewer's EEP sky stays stock.
uniform float ss_horizon_mirror;

// <SS:Nexii> The horizon clip (SSAtmoEnvAtmosphere::mHorizonClip), sampled at the applied phase like the mirror - the same uniform skyF.glsl reads for the depth write and the optics cut. 1 while the authored sky asks for the hard waterline: the lower dome draws (to take the disc with it), and the sun's glow and haze effects stop at the horizon line - see the fade below.
uniform float ss_horizon_clip;

// <SS:Nexii> The sun's horizon-band share (SSAtmoEnvApplier::sunRiseFraction): 1 the whole time the disc's centre stands at or above the horizon, easing smoothly to 0 across the twilight band below it; 0 also means no active Atmo environment, which is exactly stock. The dome's light and its sun glow are ramped on this below. Stock switches BOTH the moment the disc's centre crosses zero - and the first cut of the ramp ran it across the disc's own span, which scaled the glow down by the risen share of the disc and halved the sunset exactly where the authored skies put it at full strength. So the band runs DOWN from the horizon instead: the disc's light hits the atmosphere long before the disc reaches the horizon and keeps lighting it long after, and the ramp now honours both - full glow from centre-rise to centre-set, the dusk easing out below.
uniform float ss_sun_rise;

// <SS:Nexii> The sun's TRUE direction while the rise band is live (SSAtmoEnvApplier::sunSlotDirection). The shared lightnorm direction switches from the sun to the moon the moment the disc's CENTRE sets (LLSettingsSky::getLightDirection) - stock never saw it because stock zeroes the glow and culls the disc below the horizon, but the ramps keep both alive through the whole band, dusk included, and the takeover rule is sun > moon until the band is spent: the glow and the extinction below keep aiming at the SUN while ss_sun_rise is positive, and the moon takes the lightnorm back only once it is not.
uniform vec3 ss_sun_dir;

// <SS:Nexii> The disc's half-angle as a direction-z sine (SSAtmoEnvApplier::sunSlotRadius) - the unit the horizon band is sized in. The extinction below holds the sun's airmass at the JUST-CLEARED path (off_axis 1/radius at the horizon line) while the rise band is live - through the whole rise AND the whole dusk below the horizon - because elevation 0 is not the horizon-sitting airmass - it is the infinite one, and 1/max(1e-6, rel_pos.y + 0) collapses every horizon ray to unlit. The floor releases continuously once the centre climbs past it, and the afterglow keeps the just-cleared light path while the band's share fades it out. Zero while no Atmo environment drives the sky.
uniform float ss_sun_radius;

// <SS:Nexii> The optics' light colour's MOONLIGHT fallback, bound by the sky pool: while no sun band is live the optics are the moonlight family, which deliberately keeps its faint white tint (moonlight optics are not wired to their own light yet). The sun-band case is computed here in the vertex shader (vary_ss_optic_sun_col above); this uniform only stands in below the band.
uniform vec3 ss_optic_sun_col;

// <SS:Nexii> The stock ray lift. The atmosphere ray below is computed 50 m above the geometry it belongs to (the + vec3(0, 50, 0) in rel_pos), a legacy fudge that once rode along with the stock sun disc's own legacy 50 m drop (sunDiscV.glsl) - glow hotspot and drawn disc wrong together, which passed for agreement. The Atmo discs draw at the TRUE direction (ssCelestialV.glsl carries no offset of any kind), so while they own the sky the lift drops to 0 and the glow hotspot lands on the disc: 50 m of lift at the ~5000 m dome is 0.57 degrees, about one sun-diameter of visible droop. 1 is exactly stock - 50 * 1.0 is the same ray bit for bit - which is what an enabled-but-idle viewer keeps.

// <SS:Nexii> The glow light's extinction ceiling, in optical depths on the densest attenuation channel. 2.0 is the warm-orange horizon band of a real sunset - deep enough to burn, shallow enough to stay bright; raise it toward the darker reds, lower it toward the golds.

An authored sky that asks for the clip asked for the hard waterline instead, so the directional glow term fades out over SS_SUN_HORIZON_FADE below the line (sine of the angle below eye level - scale-free, the same cut from any height) and only the mirrored AIR - the body terms - continues below.

    // <SS:Nexii> Below the horizon, mirror the ray instead of collapsing it. Stock stretches a below-horizon ray to 32000 units, and separately the sunlight term below clamps its elevation with max(0., rel_pos_norm.y). Together those make the lower dome black: full extinction over an enormous path, lit by ambient alone. That is invisible as long as land or water covers the lower dome, and it does not. A flat sea of radius R seen from height h ends atan(h/R) below eye level, so there is always a wedge between the water's edge and the true horizon - about two degrees at twenty metres up - with nothing in it but lower dome. Hence the black band under a sunset, widening as you climb, papered over only when cloud coverage is high enough to fill it. Mirroring shades a ray a degree below the horizon exactly like one a degree above, so the haze simply carries on down. Continuous at the horizon, and truer than black: what is actually down there is the same air, seen along the same sort of path. Runtime-gated by ss_horizon_mirror (see the uniform note above): with the mirror off, the stock behaviour below is restored exactly - the -32000 branch stays compiled because the SS_ATMO variant serves both the idle (stock collapse) and active (mirror) cases per frame, and under the mirror it is simply unreachable: the abs keeps y >= 0. The mirror is for the AIR terms only - extinction and haze body, which have no direction of their own. The directional terms (the glow's hotspot, the rainbow and halo strip, the weather optics) scatter from the light at a TRUE angle, so they read the ray captured here before the flip: feeding them the mirrored ray painted a second copy of the sun's glow and corona below the horizon, the mirror image of the one above it.

(A radial fade of the extinction around the disc was tried first and read as a giant ball: the window's inner zone rode the hotspot at full strength, the mid-ring swept through the deepest saturation, and the window's edge popped back to the crushed sky - a bullseye around the sun quad, which is itself correct.) So instead the glow's extinction is CAPPED: its airmass may not exceed the depth at which the densest attenuation channel has shed SS_SUN_GLOW_DEPTH optical depths - scaled uniformly across the channels, so the hue survives and the band deepens TO its colour, never through it and out the other side. Where the beam maths is mild the cap never binds and the stock line stands; it only binds where the crush was total, and a min() has no edge to see - the grey band simply becomes the bright warm gradient a real sunset carries, core to horizon and on down past it. Density keeps every other duty untouched - the dome body, the blue_horizon wash, the distance haze, the (1 - combined_haze) scale.

The max() is what makes the lift monotone in cover at EVERY ambient: above 1 the headroom goes negative and the unguarded form darkens the sky as cover rises, the opposite of what the line above says it does. That is not an unreachable case - Atmo's ambient swatch is scaled by 3 and EEP validates ambient to [0,3] - and until the consolidation cloudsV.glsl carried the unguarded form, so an HDR-ambient sky put the cirrus band and this dome on different ambients at the rim they are supposed to meet on.

    // Dim sunlight by cloud shadow percentage
    // <SS:Nexii> ssairlightcore.h : dimByCloudShadow(). The max() is inert for every cloud_shadow the viewer binds ([0,1], validated and dialled) and stops the unguarded form from NEGATING the light above 1; cloudsV.glsl now carries it too.

The nested root is the shader's own (the sqrt above halves the depth, this one roots the already-rooted value).

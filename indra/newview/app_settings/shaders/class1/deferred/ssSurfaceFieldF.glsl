// (a 4 cm drop lattice is at 3200 by one region's width, the 2.5 cm sparkle lattice at 10240), so sin() was being evaluated at arguments of
// 10^5 to 10^6 radians - past where GPU sin() is specified to hold precision at all (NVIDIA documents sinf accuracy only for |x| <= 48039) and
// where the F32 argument itself is already quantised to a thirty-second of a radian. Whatever a given driver does there it is not a hash any more.
// Same idiom and same constants as ssPuddleLatHash/ssStateHash in ssSurfaceStateF.glsl, which the shore carve and the world noise already use -

    // the surface at all: it is something in the column, and the field has nothing to say about it. Avatars are the case that matters - they are not in the capture, so a fragment on someone's
    // shoulder used to sail through the test below as "the top of its own column" and shade with the wetness of the pavement they were standing on. Their wetness has its own model now (see
    // ssavatarwet.h); this hands back "no answer" so the two cannot fight over the same fragment. The tolerance is generous on purpose. The stored height is a metre -ish cell average, so a genuine

        // 2.35 cells above the fragment. At the shipping 2 m cell that is 4.7 m, taller than every ordinary room, so an indoor floor read as open
        // sky and wetted, which is the "surface drops indoors" defect. No march is needed for the answer: reaching this branch AT ALL means the
        // window's stored top for this column is more than half a cell above this fragment, and that stored top is where a drop falling through

        // column and a thin wall's ridge is otherwise indistinguishable from a roof: cover has to be BROAD to shelter a floor. At a 2 m cell that
        // means at least three cells, 6 m across; a narrower lip reads as open, which is what it did before, so the error runs toward wet.
